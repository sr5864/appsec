My cov1.gft file makes use of the animate case 0x02 and 0x03 functions.
My cov2.gft files makes use of the animate case 0x04 function.
My fuzzer2.gft file expolits the animate case 0x04 function by making arg2 too big for the alloted amount of registers.
My fuzzer1.gft file exploits the animate case 0x03 function by creating a null pointer.
I have created fixes for both crashes and some other bug fixes as well such as making sure that the user added a file to read and checing for a null poiter in the animate case 0x02.
